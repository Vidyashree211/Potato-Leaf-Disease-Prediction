# Potato-Leaf-Disease-Prediction
In modern agriculture, timely and accurate detection of plant diseases is crucial for ensuring crop health and optimizing yield. This project focuses on developing a customized convolutional neural network (CNN) based system for classifying and predicting  potato leaf diseases.

Potato leaf diseases pose significant challenges to farmers, leading to reduced crop yields and economic losses. Traditional methods for disease identification are often labour-intensive, time-consuming, and require expert knowledge. By leveraging deep learning techniques, the system aims to accurately identify and predict various potato diseases from images of potato leaves.

The primary components of this project include data collection, pre-processing, model architecture, model training, evaluation.

Tools and Technologies: Sequential Model, AlexNet, VGG-16, VGG-19, ResNet50
Programming language: Python
Dataset Source: Kaggle

Conclusion: VGG19 is the best performing algorithm with an accuracy of 92.55% to classify and predict the potato leaf disease.
